            </ol>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                These job roles have been carefully identified based on current market demand, scope for self-employment, and opportunities within both urban and semi-urban settings.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Through structured training, practical exposure, and competency-based learning, the programme seeks to equip participants with job-ready skills, technical knowledge, and professional work ethics. Emphasis will be placed on hands-on training, safety standards, and industry best practices to ensure participants are well-prepared for gainful employment or independent livelihood generation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                By implementing this initiative, KRDC aims to strengthen human capital, support youth empowerment, and contribute to the socio-economic advancement of the Koch Rajbongshi community, while aligning with the broader objectives of national skill development and workforce readiness.
